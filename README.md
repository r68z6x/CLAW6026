Due to the bonus points, Julie was able to redeem a free ticket from the airline. The conditions of the program are that the points can only be redeemed for tickets for herself and are not transferable. Because of her work commitments she is unable to use the ticket, and it expired on 30 June 2024.
In the same year of tax, Julie gave her twin nieces each a birthday present of one earring each from a pair of pearl earrings she owned. The pair of earrings had a value of $5,000. She had acquired the pair of earrings at a jewellery fair in 1999 by trading a necklace valued at $900.

Axel intended to hold its interest in Black Pty Ltd as a long-term investment. Owing to unforeseen circumstances, farming proved to be unprofitable and there was a zoning change in 2023 whereby properties in the area could only be disposed of in 25- hectare parcels. Black Pty Ltd borrowed $1 million in December 2023 to hire lawyers and surveyors to divide up the property. In January 2024 Black had sold all the 25- hectare parcels to a single buyer for a profit of $5 million and invested the proceeds to buy more land. Axel Ltd and Greedy Ltd then sold their interests in Black Pty Ltd for $10 million in June 2024.
Explain the income tax implications of the above transactions for Axel and Black. You must cite relevant sections, case law and tax rulings in support of your answer.
